# The Customers App

Now let's take a look at the equivalent of the Customers API but in Web App form.
This application is written in Blazor, but the technique and approach applies for other .NET technologies such as MVC and even WebForms.

The idea is the same. We can:

- Create a customer
- Retrieve all customers
- Retrieve a single customer
- Update a customer
- Delete a customer


## Creating a customer

![](/img/integration/add-customer.gif)

## Retrieving all customers

![](/img/integration/retrieve-customers.gif)

## Retrieving a single customer

![](/img/integration/retrieve-customer.gif)

## Updating a customer

![](/img/integration/update-customer.gif)

## Deleting a customer

![](/img/integration/delete-customer.gif)
